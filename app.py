    **Monte Carlo simulation** runs thousands of possible future scenarios using random market returns within realistic ranges.
    
    **Why use it?** The future is uncertain! Instead of one "average" projection, we show you the range of possible outcomes:
    
    - **P90 (Optimistic)**: Only 10% of simulations did better than this - your "lucky" scenario
    - **P50 (Median)**: The middle outcome - your "typical" scenario  
    - **P10 (Pessimistic)**: Only 10% of simulations did worse - your "unlucky" scenario
    
    **The shaded bands** show you the uncertainty. Wider bands = more risk/volatility.
    
    **Example**: If Invest P50 is $2M and Buy P50 is $1.8M, the typical investing outcome beats buying by $200k, 
    but look at the P10 values to understand downside risk!

**üìä Understanding the Chart:**
- **P50 (Median)**: The middle outcome - 50% of simulations do better, 50% do worse. This is your "typical" scenario.
- **P10-P90 Band**: The range covering 80% of possible outcomes. P10 means only 10% of simulations did worse, P90 means 90% did worse.
- **Wider bands = More uncertainty**: Investing typically has wider bands due to market volatility.
